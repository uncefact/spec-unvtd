# Certificate Of Origin
A form which certifies expressly that a set of goods originated in a specific country. They are used in trade policy measures which are not related to the granting of tariff preferences. Note, the working group has specifically considered Non-Preferential CoOs, those that relate to rules of origin that are not linked to Free Trade Agreements. Non-Preferential CoOs are also used as part of a Letter of Credit or Call for Tender. Can also be used in the administration of the importer as proof of origin.
