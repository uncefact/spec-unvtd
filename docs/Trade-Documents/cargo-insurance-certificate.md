# Cargo Insurance Document
The Cargo Insurance Document serves to provide evidence of insurance coverage, fulfilling various international trade and regulatory needs. Depending on context, it may be presented as:

- Certificate of Insurance and Insurance Policy: typically issued at the shipper’s request, often to fulfil Letter of Credit requirements.
- Debit Note (of insurance): typically issued in specific countries upon the consignee’s request to comply with import customs requirements.
